# Codewars

Codewars it's an app that fetches a given user's authored Challenges


## Description

This app contains 3 screens:
1. HomeFragment - where a user should insert a valid user name and fetch a list of authored challenges
2. ChallengesListFragment - where authored challenges are displayed
3. ChallengeDetailsFragment - where challenge details are displayed

A list of valid uses can be found at: https://www.codewars.com/users/leaderboard.

If a valid user name doesn't return any authored challenges then an empty screen will be shown with an animation, saying that the user has no authored challenges
